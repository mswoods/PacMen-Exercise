# PacMen-Exercise

## Description
This project creates a web page that produces a PacMan with the click of a button and moves them around the page. When the "Add Packman" button is clicked a new PacMan image is added to the web page. More specifically it adds the PacMan image to the "game" div on the web page. It is then added to the array of PacMen, which keeps track of the position and velocity of each PacMan. When the “Start Game” button is clicked the PacMan starts moving at a random speed and direction. Once the PacMan reaches the browser frame boarder it bounces off any wall it hits and changes direction. This project uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create the dynamic experience.

## Deployment
The solution is easy to deploy. First, download the files to your local machine and make sure they are in put into the same directory. Using a browser, simply open up the index.html file.
